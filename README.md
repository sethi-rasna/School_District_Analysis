# PyCity Schools District Analysis
## Overview

AFter doing initial analysis on the school district to determine where to allocate funding, we have come to learn that the results for the ninth grade class at Thomas High School were tampered with. Therefore, we had to go back through our analysis, remove the values of that data and re-calculate the values of comparison. 

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
  - The district overall did better when the ninth-graders test scores were removed. This is because the reported scores may have been lower than the actual scores these students received.
- How is the school summary affected?
  - The school summary is impacted by the fact that all the data for Thomas High School had changed. It became a smaller and better performing school with the new analysis.
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading schools affect Thomas high School's performance relative to other schools?
  - Thomas High School performed significantly higher when the ninth-grader students were removed, making it one of the top schools (which it was original one of the bottom schools) in the analysis.
- How does replacing the ninth0grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
    - The scores for ninth grade were impacted and therefore could not be formatted properly because there was a NaN value in the set for each. 
  - Scores by school spending
    - The scores went up overall. There was a high rate of school spending per capita as a result of Thomas High School becoming smaller. This led to the school receiving more money per student.
  - Scores by school size
    - The school size for Thomas High became small and therefore, the scores for medium size schools went up. 
  - Scores by school type
    - This was not really impacted because the school types were reported correctly.
